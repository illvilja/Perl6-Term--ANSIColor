Module for supporting ANSI Control sequences in Perl 6

This module is intended to be a port of the Perl 5 module
Term::ANSIColor.

It is just created, so it's not even an embryo of a Perl 6 module yet.
Another way to view it is that the module right now is 100% full of
fail, which is the optimal start for an OSS project.  Things simply
can only get better from now on.

The first steps will be to create the color() and colored() functions
already present in the Perl 5 module.  When doing so, I will include
support not only for ANSI colors 0 through 7 but also for 8 through
15 as well.  This for two reasons: It will vastly increase the
usability of the module and it will basically be a no-brainer
to implement colors 8 - 15 when I'm already working with 0 - 7.

Constants functions will show up later, when someone (possibly me)
who knows how to use AUTOLOAD in Perl 6 tries to implement them.

    A lot of inspiration will naturally come from Russ Allbery's
    Perl 5 Term::ANSIColor.

    Inspiration of how to setup a Perl 6 module in general comes
    from Moritz Lenz' json module.

    Thanks to Jonathan Leto on advice on how to get started with
    git and github.com

    Thanks to Carl MÃ¤sak and the other folks on #perl6 on freenode
    for just being very encouraging
